                <h3>Problem:</h3>
                <p id="problemContext">Winter is here and MHC is planning to string a twinkling lights around campus.
                    However, the college has limited budget, so they decided to decorate only around some of the center buildings.
                    Because they are so busy with other works, they appointed you to help them find the optimal rounds around these buildings to string
                    the lights. Let's help them!
                </p>
                <h3>How to play:</h3>
                <p>Using Krusal's algorithm, start select the edges by clicking it. The selected edges will change color. The game will automatically 
                    check your result when you finish covered all the nodes by choosing edges. Your result should be the Minimum Spanning Tree.
                </p>
                <h3>What's a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):</h3>
                <p> It's a minimum-cost spanning tree - tree that touches every vertex with the sum of edge lengths in the tree is minimum.
                </p>
                <h3>What's Krusal's Algorithm:</h3>
                <p> It is the algorithm that help to find the MST. So first, you sort edges by cost in ascending order. Then, you add each edge if it does
                    not create a cycle.
